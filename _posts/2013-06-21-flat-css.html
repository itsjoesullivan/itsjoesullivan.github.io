<p><b>flat.css</b> is an experimental css framework that explores a truly "flat" / non-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph">skeomorphic</a> design.</p>

<p>My own view is that skeumorphism is very useful and that the flattening of design will be a gradual process--the need to anchor UI elements in the physical world will diminish as web design become a universal aesthetic in its own right. In the meantime, flat.css skips ahead to the logical conclusion.</p>
<p>But the result was cool enough that I used it for my home page. It's written in <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>, stands on top of <a href="http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/">normalize.css</a> and lives <a href="http://itsjoesullivan.github.io/flat.css/">here</a></p>
