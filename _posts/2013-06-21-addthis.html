<p>I spent Winter '11 to Spring '13 as a javascript developer for AddThis.</p>
<p>During that time I maintained browser extensions reaching 1M+ users, served as lead developer for a new product, the Welcome Bar, and became lead developer of the overall AddThis sharing widget.</p>
<p>On top of writing code, I ran QA and deployed the tool, which reaches most Americans weekly.</p>
